In object-oriented programming, inheritance allows classes to inherit behaviors and attributes from other classes. This promotes code reusability and helps in building hierarchical class structures. Polymorphism, another key concept, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is achieved through method overriding and method overloading, enabling flexibility and modularity in code design. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world, and can only be accessed through publicly exposed methods. Together, these concepts form the foundation of robust and maintainable software systems.
