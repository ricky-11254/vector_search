Data structures are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. Arrays provide a contiguous block of memory for storing elements of the same data type, accessed by index. Linked lists, on the other hand, consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This dynamic structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations. Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, with each node having a value and references to child nodes. They are used extensively in algorithms such as binary search and AVL trees for efficient searching and sorting.
