Sorting algorithms are crucial in organizing data efficiently. Bubble sort iteratively compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, progressing through the list until no swaps are needed. Merge sort divides the list into smaller sublists, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together. This divide-and-conquer approach ensures a stable and efficient sorting process. Searching algorithms, such as binary search, operate on sorted data structures to quickly locate a target value by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. These algorithms are essential tools for optimizing performance in data processing and retrieval.
